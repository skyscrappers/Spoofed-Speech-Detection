With the rise of advanced technologies like text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion, it has become easier than ever to create fake voices that sound just like real people. This poses a big problem for systems that rely on voice recognition to verify a person’s identity, known as Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems. These fake voice attacks, called spoofing attacks, can trick ASV systems, leading to security risks.

Traditional methods to detect these attacks focus only on analyzing the audio. While they work well against common types of fake voices, they often fail when faced with new, more sophisticated attacks that they haven’t been trained to recognize. This makes it hard to rely on them in real-world situations where new threats keep emerging.

To make voice-based security systems smarter and more reliable, we combine two powerful tools:

Deep Learning for Audio Analysis: We use a deep learning model that listens to the audio and identifies patterns that might indicate whether the voice is real or fake. This model is good at spotting common signs of tampering in the audio.

Language Model Reasoning: In addition to audio analysis, we bring in the power of a Large Language Model (LLM), like GPT-4, during the verification process. The LLM helps by analyzing the content of what’s being said. For example, if someone is pretending to be a famous person, the LLM can check if the statement matches what that person is known to say based on publicly available information.

By combining these two approaches, the system doesn’t just “listen” to the voice but also “understands” the meaning of the words. If the LLM finds something suspicious in the content, it can help flag the audio as potentially fake. If the LLM is unsure, the system relies on the deep learning model’s judgment alone.

This combination makes the system more robust, adaptable to new types of spoofing attacks, and better prepared for real-world challenges.
